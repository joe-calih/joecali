Perfect! I've now added breadcrumbs to ALL pages in the correct position (right after the header/opening container) and ensured they include proper schema.org structured data for SEO optimization. The breadcrumbs will automatically generate based on the URL path and will show on all pages except the homepage, including all dynamic pages like blogs, LUTs, Lightroom presets, samples, and albums.

The shop page has also been updated to remove the sidebar, add filters before the products, and implement pagination for 12 products per page.
