## Behind the Album

Neon Nights was recorded over six months in Electric Dreams' home studio, using a combination of vintage analog synthesizers and modern digital workstations. The album draws inspiration from classic 80s films, video games, and the neon-soaked aesthetic of retro-futurism.

The creative process involved extensive experimentation with vintage gear, including a Moog Minimoog, Roland Jupiter-8, and Yamaha DX7, combined with modern plugins and production techniques to create a sound that's both nostalgic and contemporary.
